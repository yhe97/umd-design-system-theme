# UMD Design System Base Drupal Theme

Provided by the UMD Libraries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please see <https://github.com/umd-lib/umdlib-design-system-theme> for the Libraries' continued work on this concept.

Base theme implementing the UMD Design System[^1] using Drupal's
Single Directory Components (SDC)[^2].

Find currently created SDCs under /components.

## Current Status

Currently developed version 1.x. All work should be done against this branch.

## Installation

To install, you can either:

* Clone this repository (main branch) into your themes directory (preferred method if you intend to develop or submit pull requests)
* Install using composer (preferred if you plan to subtheme off this theme)

```bash
composer require umd-lib/umd-design-system-theme
```

See: https://packagist.org/packages/umd-lib/umd-design-system-theme

## Usage

This theme can be used as a base theme or in UI configuration.

To create a new subtheme based on this theme, first create a new theme folder
and set umdds as the *base theme*.

E.g.,

```YAML
name: New Terp Theme
type: theme
description: Sub-theme of UMDDS
core_version_requirement: ^11
base theme: umdds
```

Sub-theme templates can then employ SDCs when displaying content[^3]

For example, to hardcode a hero component, use the {{ include() }} or {% embed %} tag:

```twig
{{ include('umdds:umd-element-hero', {
    variant: 'minimal',
    theme: 'light',
    hero_image: 'https://www.lib.umd.edu/sites/default/files/styles/optimized/public/2022-02/McKeldin%20Library%201920x550.jpg',
    hero_image_alt: 'McKeldin Library',
    eyebrow: 'Sports News',
    hero_title: 'Maryland Wins'
    }, with_context = false)
}}
```

Or with field content, such as in a node.html.twig:

```twig
{{ include('umdds:umd-element-hero', {
    variant: 'minimal',
    theme: 'light',
    hero_image: {{ file_url(content.field_hero_image[0]['#media'].field_media_image.entity.uri.value | image_style('optimized')) }},
    hero_image_alt: {{ content.field_hero_image[0]['#media'].field_media_image.alt }},
    eyebrow: {{ content.field_eyebrow|field_value }},
    hero_title: {{ node.title.value }}
    }, with_context = false)
}}
```

Note that if overriding individual SDCs, you will want to sub-theme even if only
using UI Patterns or similar. In this case, you can override individual SDCs
using the _replaces_ syntax[^5]:

```YAML
replaces: 'sdc_theme_test:my-card'
```

However the intention is that these components be used to site build in the UI
using the UI Patterns[^4] module alongside Layout Builder or field configuration.

See the [libraries/main](https://github.com/umd-lib/umd-design-system-theme/tree/libraries/main)
branch for examples of how to override SDCs.

## Upgrading Theme to Latest Design System

Because the theme comes with JS and precompiled CSS, this procedure should only be
necessary when upgrading the theme for a Design System upgrade.

### Design System / Tailwind CSS

To pull the node modules, run the following:

```bash
npm install
```

To recompile the UMDDS CSS, run the following command:

```bash
npx tailwindcss --input css/base/ui.css --output css/design-system/compiled.css
```

Which will evaluate src/index.css configuration and pipe the complied file
to css/design-system/compiled.css.

Also copy node_modules/@universityofmaryland/web-components-library/dist/index.js
to js/design-system/index.js
